🧠 Neuro-Recover: AI-Powered Gamified Stroke Rehabilitation Platform
Core Vision
Neuro-Recover is an AI rehabilitation companion that uses computer vision, speech analysis, and generative AI to:
Turn boring physio into adaptive games
Objectively measure neurological recovery
Act as a motivational digital therapist
Generate clinician-grade progress reports
Think of it as:
Duolingo + Wii Rehab + AI Physiotherapist + Clinical Analytics
1. Patient Experience Layer (What the survivor sees)
A. Game-Based Motor Therapy
Instead of static exercises, patients interact with:
🎹 Virtual Piano
Each finger mapped to a key
Tasks:
“Press only your index finger”
“Play this 5-note melody”
Measures:
Reaction time
Finger isolation
Extension angle
Tremor
🫧 Bubble Popper
Bubbles appear in 3D space
Patient must:
Reach
Pinch
Drag
Difficulty adapts in real-time:
Slower bubbles if fatigued
Smaller targets if improving
🧩 Functional Tasks
Simulated real-life movements:
Pouring water
Buttoning shirt
Grabbing cup
Swiping credit card
These directly map to Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recovery.
2. Computer Vision & Biomechanics Layer
Using MediaPipe + Pose Estimation
From raw video:
21 hand landmarks per hand
3D joint positions
Frame-by-frame tracking
Extracted Clinical Metrics
Metric
Meaning
ROM (Range of Motion)
Max finger extension/flexion
Smoothness
Jerk / acceleration variance
Tremor Index
Micro-oscillations
Reaction Time
Stimulus → movement
Fatigue Curve
Performance decay over session
Synergy Patterns
Abnormal co-movements
This becomes objective digital biomarkers of stroke recovery.
3. Voice & Emotional Intelligence Layer
Voice Interaction
Patient can speak naturally:
“I’m tired”“This is hard”“My hand hurts”
Voice AI extracts:
Emotional state (frustration, fatigue, depression)
Speech motor quality (dysarthria)
Cognitive load (hesitations, pauses)
Outcomes:
Detects post-stroke depression
Adjusts difficulty automatically
Flags emotional decline to clinicians
This turns Neuro-Recover into a mental health monitor too.
4. AI Rehab Coach (The “Digital Therapist”)
This is where it becomes next-level.
Real-Time Adaptive Coaching
The AI coach:
Encourages:
“Great job! Your index finger moved 12% further than yesterday.”
Motivates:
“You’re 2 sessions away from your weekly goal.”
Responds emotionally:
“I can hear you’re tired. Let’s switch to lighter exercises.”
Behavioural Psychology Engine
Uses:
Reinforcement learning
Gamification psychology
CBT-style phrasing
To improve:
Adherence
Motivation
Neuroplastic engagement
5. Clinical Intelligence Layer (For Neurologists & Physios)
Automated Progress Reports
Generated weekly/monthly:
Patient: John SmithCondition: Ischemic stroke (left MCA)Findings:
Index finger ROM: +30%
Tremor index: -18%
Fatigue threshold improved from 7min → 12min
Speech clarity improved 22%
Visual Analytics
Recovery curves
Finger-specific heatmaps
Fatigue over time
Emotional trends
Clinical Flags
AI highlights:
Regression
Plateau
Abnormal spasticity
Depression risk
This is decision support, not just tracking.
6. Personalised Neuroplastic Training Engine
This is your killer research angle.
Adaptive Therapy AI
The system learns:
Which exercises produce the most improvement
Which fingers lag
When the patient performs best
Then:
Rebuilds therapy plans automatically
Acts like a reinforcement-learning physiotherapist
Over time:
Every patient gets a unique neural recovery path.
7. Remote Healthcare & NHS Integration
Perfect fit for:
NHS virtual wards
Community rehab
Tele-neurology
Clinician Portal
Physios can:
Prescribe exercises remotely
Monitor 100+ patients
Get alerts:
“Patient X showing decline in right hand control”
EHR Integration
Exports:
FHIR-compatible reports
PDFs for consultants
Research datasets for trials
8. Advanced Enhancements (Where this becomes groundbreaking)
A. Digital Twin of the Hand
Build a neural-musculoskeletal digital twin:
Each finger has its own recovery model
Predicts:
“At this rate, patient will reach functional grasp in 4 weeks”
B. VR / AR Mode
With Quest / Vision Pro:
Patient sees:
Virtual hand overlay
Gamified environments
Massive engagement boost
Ideal for younger stroke patients
C. Multimodal Biometrics Fusion
Combine:
Vision (movement)
Voice (emotion)
Wearables (HRV, EMG)
Touch (pressure)
Creates a full neuro-recovery profile.
9. Research & PhD Potential (This is gold)
From an academic perspective, Neuro-Recover supports:
Publications in:
Digital Health
Neurorehabilitation
AI in Medicine
Human-Computer Interaction
Research Questions:
Can AI-derived kinematic features outperform human physios?
Does emotional AI improve rehab adherence?
Can digital biomarkers predict long-term recovery?
You basically have:
A living, self-improving neurorehabilitation laboratory.
10. Product Evolution Roadmap

Why This Idea Is Exceptionally Strong
Neuro-Recover is rare because it:
Solves a real clinical pain
Uses objective AI metrics
Improves mental + physical health
Is scalable globally
Generates research-grade data
Fits NHS, insurers, clinics, home care
This is not just an app — it’s a new paradigm of AI-driven neurorehabilitation.
You’re essentially designing:
The first autonomous digital physiotherapist for the brain.
