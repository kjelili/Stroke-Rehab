# --- Deployment mode: edge vs cloud ---
# Edge: runs entirely on device (hospital tablet, community laptop, rural clinic). No internet required.
# Set VITE_EDGE_MODE=true for edge builds. Optional alternative: VITE_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=edge
# VITE_EDGE_MODE=true
# VITE_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=edge

# Cloud: MedGemma-style AI backend (progress report, clinician summary, coaching, dysarthria, clinical suggestions).
# Leave unset or empty to use in-app rule-based fallbacks (works in edge mode).
# VITE_MEDGEMMA_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
